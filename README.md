# Enterprise Network Home Lab


## Project Overview

This Project is designed to simulate a small enterprise IT environment using virtual machines, Windows Server, Active Directory, and workstations. We will first start by setting up the network topology and apply some security to it as well, progessing to the goal of build a foundation in IT operations while gradually expanding into security-focused workflows like SOC monitoring, endpoint telemetry, and secure network architecture.

> The home lab is divided into several hands-on project areas:

## Initial lab Objective


To simulate an enterprise-style network environment I used Cisco Packet Tracer. I focused on VLAN segmentation, ACL-based inter-VLAN security, and Active Directory integration. However some features were limited because of Packet Tracer, architectural placeholders and labeling were used to demonstrate future implementation plans. This emulated my future plans of buying physical devices and making my homelab.




### Skills Learned


- VLAN segmentation and trunk/access port configuration

- Inter-VLAN routing using subinterfaces and dot1Q

- ACL configuration to enforce security boundaries

- DNS/DHCP/HTTP services deployment

- Active Directory server integration and domain join

- Manual IP and DNS assignments

- Network monitoring via SIEM (simulated)

- IPS placement and traffic inspection (simulated)

- MDM segmentation for IoT/mobile device management



### Tools/Assets Used

VLAN segmentation / Device & IP Configuration

VLANs configured on the switch

Access ports assigned per device

Subinterfaces on the router with dot1Q encapsulation enabled for inter-VLAN routing

Lab Router Interfaces:

G0/0 (to ISP): 192.168.1.2

G0/1 (to switch): Trunk port

Switch Ports:

Port to Lab Router: Trunk

Other ports: Access mode, assigned to VLANs

IP Schema:

VLAN 10 (Users): 10.10.10.0/24

VLAN 20 (AD Server): 10.20.20.0/24

VLAN 30 (Guest/IoT/MDM): 10.30.30.0/24:  <br/>

I then verified that inter-VLAN communication was initially possible, confirming that routing between VLAN 10 and VLAN 20 functioned as expected prior to applying ACL restrictions: <br/>

ACL Rules for Inter-VLAN Security

Purpose: Block ICMP traffic between VLANs to simulate enterprise-grade segmentation and internal zoning.
Bidirectional ICMP denial was enforced to model enterprise segmentation best practices where mutual isolation enhances security and detection control.:  <br/>

Active Directory Server Configuration (VLAN 20)

Services configured on server:

DHCP, DNS, HTTP (HTTP disabled for security)

DNS server IP: 10.20.20.5 :  <br/>

PC Domain Join to AD (VLAN 10)

DNS pointed to the AD server (10.20.20.5)

PC successfully joined the domain:  <br/>

Security Infrastructure Additions

Added additional ACL rules to the Lab Router for the VLANS
IPS placed between ISP and Lab Router to inspect and block malicious traffic before reaching internal devices.

MDM VLAN (30) added for laptops, phones, and a printer to isolate and manage mobile/IoT assets securely.

SIEM in VLAN 10 monitors access, IPS, firewall, ACL, and IoT logs for centralized threat visibility :  <br/>

Security Measures Implemented

HTTP disabled on AD server to minimize exposure

ACLs enforced segmentation between VLANs

DNS assigned manually to ensure proper AD resolution

ICMP blocked between segmented VLANs to simulate zoning/security boundaries

SIEM implemented in VLAN 10 to monitor access logs, firewall logs, IPS logs, ACL logs, and IoT traffic

IPS added between ISP modem and Lab Router to inspect incoming external traffic

VLAN 30 used for IoT, mobile, and printer devices with MDM security policies applied

This concludes the Cisco Packet Tracer simulation phase. The next step is to implement this setup using physical equipment (pfSense router/firewall, managed switch, crimped Cat6 cabling) and fully enable advanced firewall features.
